      <h2>Introduction to Repentance and Salvation</h2>
      <p>Repentance and salvation form the foundation of the Christian faith. This lesson explores what it means to turn from sin and embrace God's gift of salvation through Jesus Christ.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Scriptures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." - Romans 3:23</li>
        <li>"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." - Romans 6:23</li>
        <li>"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." - 1 John 1:9</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>What is Repentance?</h3>
      <p>Repentance is more than feeling sorry for our sins. It involves a complete change of mind and heart that leads to a change in action. True repentance means turning away from sin and turning toward God.</p>
      
      <h3>Understanding Salvation</h3>
      <p>Salvation is God's free gift to us. We cannot earn it through good works or religious activities. It comes through faith in Jesus Christ, who died for our sins and rose again.</p>
      
      <h3>The Process of Salvation</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Recognition of Sin:</strong> Acknowledging our sinful nature and specific sins.</li>
        <li><strong>Repentance:</strong> Turning away from sin and toward God.</li>
        <li><strong>Faith in Christ:</strong> Believing that Jesus died for our sins and rose again.</li>
        <li><strong>Confession:</strong> Declaring our faith in Jesus as Lord and Savior.</li>
        <li><strong>Regeneration:</strong> Experiencing new birth through the Holy Spirit.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Living in Salvation</h3>
      <p>Salvation is not just a one-time event but a lifelong journey of growing in Christ. It affects every aspect of our lives and transforms us from the inside out.</p>

      <h2>In Christ: Understanding Our New Identity</h2>
      <p>This lesson explores the profound concept of being "in Christ" and the transformative work Jesus accomplished on our behalf.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Scriptures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" - 2 Corinthians 5:17</li>
        <li>"For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things." - Colossians 1:19-20</li>
        <li>"In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace." - Ephesians 1:7</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Christ's Work on the Cross</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Forgiveness of sins</li>

        <li>Defeat of death and Satan</li>
        <li>Healing and restoration</li>
        <li>New life in the Spirit</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Our New Identity in Christ</h3>
      <p>When we accept Christ, we receive a new identity. We are no longer defined by our past, our failures, or even our accomplishments. We are defined by who we are in Christ.</p>
      
      <h3>Living from Our Position in Christ</h3>
      <p>Understanding our position in Christ changes how we live. We no longer strive to earn God's approval but live from a place of already being accepted and loved.</p>

      </ul>

      <h3>The Work of the Holy Spirit</h3>

      </ul>
      
      <h3>Understanding Lordship</h3>

      <h2>Fellowship: The Importance of Community</h2>
      <p>Christian fellowship is essential for spiritual growth. This lesson explores why we need each other and how to build meaningful relationships with other believers.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Scriptures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>"And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another." - Hebrews 10:24-25</li>
        <li>"They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer." - Acts 2:42</li>
        <li>"For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them." - Matthew 18:20</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>The Biblical Basis for Fellowship</h3>
      <p>God designed us to live in community. From the beginning, He said, "It is not good for man to be alone." The church is described as a body, a family, and a building — all metaphors of connection and interdependence.</p>
      
      <h3>Benefits of Fellowship</h3>
      <p>Fellowship provides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accountability</li>
        <li>Encouragement</li>
        <li>Support in difficult times</li>

      <h3>Practical Ways to Build Fellowship</h3>
      <p>Building meaningful relationships requires intention. Some practical ways include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular church attendance</li>
        <li>Participation in small groups</li>
        <li>Serving together</li>

      <h2>Faith in God</h2>
      <p>Faith is the foundation of our relationship with God. This lesson explores what biblical faith is and how we can develop and strengthen our trust in God.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Scriptures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>"Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see." - Hebrews 11:1</li>
        <li>"Without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him." - Hebrews 11:6</li>
        <li>"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God." - Ephesians 2:8</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>What is Faith?</h3>
      <p>Biblical faith is not blind belief or wishful thinking. It is a confident trust in God based on His character and promises. Faith has three components: knowledge, belief, and trust.</p>
      
      <h3>The Object of Our Faith</h3>
      <p>The power of faith lies not in faith itself but in its object. Our faith is in God — His character, His promises, and His power. Faith is only as good as the one in whom it is placed.</p>
      
      <h3>How Faith Grows</h3>
      <p>Faith grows through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hearing and studying God's Word</li>
        <li>Remembering God's faithfulness in the past</li>
        <li>Stepping out in obedience</li>
        <li>Persevering through trials</li>
        <li>Fellowship with other believers</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Faith in Action</h3>
      <p>True faith expresses itself in action. As James wrote, "Faith without deeds is dead." Living faith transforms not just what we believe but how we live.</p>

      <h2>The Word, Worship, and Prayer</h2>
      <p>This lesson explores the three primary ways we connect with God: through His Word, worship, and prayer.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Scriptures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness." - 2 Timothy 3:16</li>
        <li>"God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth." - John 4:24</li>
        <li>"Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God." - Philippians 4:6</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>The Word of God</h3>
      <p>The Bible is God's revelation to us. It is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inspired — given by God</li>
        <li>Authoritative — the final word on matters of faith and practice</li>
        <li>Relevant — applicable to every aspect of life</li>
        <li>Transformative — changes us as we read and apply it</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Worship</h3>
      <p>Worship is our response to who God is and what He has done. It involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adoration — expressing love and devotion</li>
        <li>Thanksgiving — expressing gratitude</li>
        <li>Surrender — yielding our will to God's</li>
        <li>Service — using our gifts to honor God</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Prayer</h3>
      <p>Prayer is communication with God. It includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adoration — praising God for who He is</li>
        <li>Confession — acknowledging sin</li>
        <li>Thanksgiving — expressing gratitude</li>
        <li>Supplication — making requests</li>
        <li>Intercession — praying for others</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Integrating These Practices</h3>
      <p>The Word, worship, and prayer are not separate activities but integrated practices that reinforce each other. The Word informs our worship and prayer; worship expresses our response to the Word; prayer helps us internalize the Word.</p>

      <h2>Reasons to Believe - Christian Apologetics</h2>
      <p>Christian apologetics is the reasoned defense of the faith. This lesson introduces the field of apologetics and explores some compelling reasons to believe.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Scriptures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>"Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect." - 1 Peter 3:15</li>

        <li>"The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands." - Psalm 19:1</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>What is Apologetics?</h3>
      <p>Apologetics comes from the Greek word "apologia," which means "a reasoned defense." It involves providing rational justification for the truth claims of Christianity.</p>
      
      <h3>Evidence for God's Existence</h3>
      <p>Several compelling arguments suggest the existence of God:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cosmological Argument:</strong> Everything that begins to exist has a cause; the universe began to exist; therefore, the universe has a cause (God).</li>
        <li><strong>Design Argument:</strong> The universe displays remarkable fine-tuning and complexity that points to an intelligent designer.</li>
        <li><strong>Moral Argument:</strong> Objective moral values exist; such values require a moral lawgiver.</li>
        <li><strong>Historical Argument:</strong> The historical evidence for Jesus' life, death, and resurrection is strong.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Common Questions and Objections</h3>
      <p>Apologetics addresses questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How can a good God allow suffering?</li>
        <li>Hasn't science disproven religion?</li>
        <li>What about other religions?</li>
